# Blvck Spades Card Matching Game

The rules are simple, match the cards and beat the time to get rewards!

## Tech Used

- NextJS
- RSC
- Mailchimp
- and some AI ;)

## Challenges Faced

- The coding for the game was fun. The challenging part was making Mailchimp work. First, I needed to have a valid business email.

- I also used their Tagging and Customer Journey features. The Journey takes a little bit of time to kick in

- Overall, this was a fun experience, thanks Jason and LWJ!
